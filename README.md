# Custom block type: Testimonial

This custom module creates a custom block type called testimonial, which can be used to create custom blocks of that type. To test the module, clone this repo and run the following commands:

1. git checkout demo
2. lando start
3. lando composer install
4. lando drush en testimonial

I've created many custom block types via the Drupal admin UI, but this is the first time I've written a module!
